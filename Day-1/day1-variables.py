# Variables
# Variables are containers (or boxes) for storing data values.

# In Python, variables are created when you assign a value to it:
# Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, 
# and can even change type after they have been set.
# Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.

# rules for variable names:
# A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
# A variable name cannot start with a number
# A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
# Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
